# Run On Privacy Policy

Run On is a free app for notifying you of incoming text messages by reading them out. Any time you're unable to use your device (running, driving, etc), Run On can read incoming messages via text-to-speech.

## What Run On uses

Run On reads incoming SMS messages out to you using on-device text-to-speech.

Run On uses your contacts to match the phone number of incoming SMS to your existing contacts, to optionally read the name instead of phone number.

## What Run On does not do

Run On does not use _any_ internet connection, and the information above is not used, sent or processed via any external services. Contact information is not stored, it is matched to the incoming message's phone number source each time and then discarded, on device.
